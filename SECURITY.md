## Reporting a Vulnerability

this project is using [greenkeeper](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper) for managing 
[dependencies](https://github.com/xsoft-technologies/Xbooks/network/dependencies) and GitHub 
[Alerts](https://github.com/xsoft-technologies/Xbooks/network/alerts) which fixes security vulnerability automatically,
however;
if you discover any security vulnerability, kindly draft it 
[here](https://github.com/xsoft-technologies/Xbooks/security/advisories/new),

maintainers would certainly look at your report and find a solution to it, but keep in mind that some vulneraabilities doesn't 
worth wasting time on; such reports will also gain respect but will be solved either by patch or automated fixes, in other cases however we try to solve it manually on branch [SecPatch](https://github.com/xsoft-technologies/Xbooks/tree/SecPatch);
so if this branch exists you know that this project is under Security Patching phase!
